Software Testing:

1) Blackbox testing: When the software tester test the website without knowing the code , its called black box testing.

Types:

- Functional testing: Done by software tester
- Non functional testing: Such as performance, Reliability, usability. ex. How many user simanteniosly use the website
- Regression Testing: When there is some change in existing application , the small change can affect the working of the application. So regression testing is something where tester checks the exiting software. to make sure evrything works fine

Functional Testing 
- Tester tests how well the system perfoms
- Functional Testing is based on client requirements
- Validate the behavior of an application
- Covers Unit testing, integration testing, smoke testing, sanity testing, regression testing
- Means how is your system is doing

Non-functional Testing
- Tester tests how well the system responds.
- Non-functional testing is based on client expectations
- Validate the performance of an application
- Covers performance testing, Volume testing, security testing, installation testing
- Means how well your system is doing

1) QA Process design
2) Network testing

Blackbox Testing Techniques:
Equivalence class testing: 
Boundary Value Testing
Decision Table Testing  
State Transition Testing
Use case Testing

WhiteBox testing Techniques:
Unit Testing
Statement Testing

Test Coverage: Means that you'll spend a certain amount of time on a function to test and cover most critical parts to be sure that no bugs will be delivered to customers.

Blackbox Testing is a software testing methond in which the internal structure/ design/ implementation of the item being tested is NOT known to the tester

Whitebox Testing is a software testing methong in which the internal structure/design/implementation of the item being tested is known to the tester.
