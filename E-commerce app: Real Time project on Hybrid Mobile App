Test-Scenarios to automate:

1. Fill the form details and verify Toast error messages displayed appropriately for wrong inputs 
2. Shop the items in the app by scrolling to specific product and add to cart
3. Validate if the items selected in the page 2 are matching with items displayed in checkout page
4. Validate the total amount displayed in the checkout page matches the sum of products selected for shopping.
5. Validate mobile gestures are working fine for links(long press) and navigate to webview 
6. Verify If user can perform operations on web view and can navigate back to native app if needed

I have attached the code file for above test scenarios.
